V  
  
Magic is, by definition, the alteration of *Fate*, through the usage of *Will*, transmitted by *Words*.  
It is the act of, instead of conforming to the world, making the world conform to you.  
Through Magic, actions which are otherwise impossible become possible, like draining an ocean and toppling a mountain.  

## Fate

The concept of Fate is something everything has, be it living or inanimate.  
It does not matter if it has been created by nature, by human hands, or from the fire of a dragon, every existing object has this intangible, unobservable component.
However, Fate isn't incorrigible. Like all other things in existence, it is influenced by the world.  
The Fate of an object is the final position it occupies, plus the path it Will go through to get there, e.g. if there is a ball rolling down the slope of a hill, it is its Fate to reach the bottom of the slope, through the action of rolling down a certain path.  

## Will

However, Fate is subject to change. It is not set in stone.
Fate is like a river, flowing down the path of least resistance. But a river can be redirected, in this case, through the usage of Will.
Will is the expression of the soul, and is exclusive to life, excluding a few exceptions.
If a being wishes to create Magic, and change the environment, Will is a necessity to this operation.
It is a force that is exuded from the soul of a being, that alters the Fate of whatever object it was directed upon, imprinting itself onto the recipient therefore changing its Fate.  
The strength of an individual's Will is directly proportional to the strength of its soul, a weak soul trying to change the Fate of a strong Fate is paramount to throwing a rock on a mountain, and expecting the mountain to fall over.
Will cannot exist in a vacuum; it must be produced by a sentient life-form AND be given intent, by which to act upon the world.
