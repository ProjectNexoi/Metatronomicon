## End-of-the-world Prophesies

### Primoridal Armageddon

In this belief, the end of the world is prophesised to a grand battle whereupon the [Leviathan](../lifeforms/primordials.html) and the Behemoth will descend from their respective moons ([Ammakinn](../cosmicarchitecture/ammakinn.html) and [Dunaydin](../cosmicarchitecture/dunaydin.html)), and attack eachother with [magic](magic.html).  
This battle is said to last for exactly 7 weeks, which at the end of, both belligerents will be exhausted and wounded from the prolonged conflict.  
Immediately after, ["The legions of divinity"](../lifeforms/angels.html) are said to come down to the world, slay the Primordials, annhilate the [un-worthy](../events/flood.html) and feed the worthy with the meat and blood of the great beasts.
