# Physics

**REWRITE M E!**

In the Metatronomicon Universe, there exists an expanded system of physics, different from ours.  
This Expansion includes two additional particles, named the "Senticule", and the "Magitron".
Additionally, two fundemental interactions, "forces", are also present, the Spiritual force, and the Magical force.
The particles mentioned above are their carriers, respectively.

## Particles

### Senticule

The Senticule, also referred to as "Soul-Matter" is a fundemental particle (e.g. it cannot be divided or broken down into smaller parts), and the carrier of the Spiritual force.  
Commonly, a [Soul](egoictrinity.html), or spirit, is thought to be indivisible and unmeasurable, as sort of an invisible, true identity, of a person and/or being.  
However, this is factually wrong. In reality, the Soul *is* measurable and violable, as a result of it existing within the natural order of existence.
It is a structure of Senticules, and can be replicated and changed. This also applies to the [Mind](egoictrinity.html).  

However, a Senticule's role does not end at merely composing a person, for it also has other uses. When a person dies, his soul destroyed, deformed or in any other way interfered with, an amount of Senticules is released, according to the magnitude of the aforementioned interference.
As a result of that, when enough Soul-Mass is accumulated, [Undead](../lifeforms/undead.html) will form in the vicinity if possible.

### Magitron

The Magitron, commonly known as "Magic", or "Magical Energy", is a fundemental particle, as well as the carreier of the Magical Force.
This particle has a unique attribute, that being that it **must** carry a certain [Will](magic.html#will). Due to its nature, a Magitron cannot exist in a vacuum, and can only be created as a result of direct intervention of a sentient being with the [Fate](magic.html#fate) of an object.
