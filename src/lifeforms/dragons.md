# Dragons

Also biologically known as "Draconia", the dragons are the direct creations of the Leviathan, an ancient being and one of the three Primordials.
The dragons are not completely biological and certain parts of them are composed out of various inorganic materials, such as rare metals and durable sediment-like substances.
These almost mechanical parts of the dragons are their scales, bones and other rigid tissue. They are constructed by the parents of the said dragon, and are filled with biological tissue and energy.
The dragon eventually fuses with the inorganic part of its body, becoming completely inseparable from it.
Dragons do not have two distinct sexes and do not possess any reproductive organs.

## Lifecycle

1. The dragon is born from a metal shell created by its parents which is infused with large amounts of their magic, soul-mass, and biological tissue. This proccess results in the creation of offspring.  
2. The newborn is nurtured by the parents for a long period of time, from a few centuries to millennia, depending on the species. This process involves teaching the young dragon of the world and training it in various things, e.g. magic and the blacksmithery needed to create the next generation. The parents continue to infuse various metals with the dragon's shell, which has by then completely fused itself with the biological tissues within the young dragon's body, creating its iconic scales and their recognizable sheen. This process also causes the dragon to grow monumentally larger than its original size.  
3. When reaching a sufficient age, the now mature dragon departs from its parents, and finds a new dwelling for itself. This stage of the dragon's life-cycle is the longest and plays the biggest part in the it's life. During this time, the dragon usually pillages and ravages the area around it, sometimes flying off to far-away locations in order to gather stronger and larger amounts of metals, in order to strengthen its carapace and grow even larger. This behavior results in the fascinating outcome that every dragon's scales are completely unique, as a result of the distinct composition they possess. Many dragons, especially the ones more adept at magic, will inscribe patterns and even portraits of the land and recognizable elements within it, such as the night sky, or a large mountain, onto their scales. Due to this, draconic scales hold immeasurable value to those in the field of archeology and historians, because these scales act as a sort of time capsule in history, which is perfectly preserved as a result of the fact that dragon scales are an extremely durable alloy of rare materials. The dragon throughout this phase of its life establishes dominance in the area it has settled in, mostly preventing any outside interference with the land it lays claim to.  
4. When the dragon has reached a certain age, unique to each species, it starts to seek out a partner, with which to produce offspring. When the dragon finds a suitable partner, one out of their dwellings is chosen, where the other one will move into. The dwelling which has not been chosen will be abandoned. All dragons are inherently monogamous, meaning that they only have one pair, in the entirety of their lives. The dragon pair then takes turns recovering sufficient materials, to create offspring. The parents then construct a shell out of the metals and various materials they have collected, to be their future child, they both inject various elements (Refer to Stage I) into the carapace, and thus create offspring. Each dragon pair can produce between 1-3 children, until they run out of the energy needed to create more children, which is when they will stop doing as such and live out the rest of their lives.

## Abilities

### Strength

All Dragons possess immense physical strength. On average, a dragon's full power is equivelant to a small nuclear armament, capable of instantly annhilating a large city. OF course, usage of this significant amount of energy drains the Dragon, thus making the said attack usable as more of a last-resort type of attack.

### Magic

### Breath

A Dragons breath is one of the abilities they possess. It is a specialized form of magic, aided by biological/mechanical mechanisms within their bodies.  
A Dragon's breath is the only known way to produce a temperature high enough to melt Dragon Scale reliably enough to use it for smithing.  
The temperature this produces rivals and sometimes even surpasses the Sun's surface temperature (~5,600Â°C)
