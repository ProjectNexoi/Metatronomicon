# Realms

The realms are a collective name for 5 distinct spaces, which comprise the entirety of creation.  
A realm's size is non-finite, and beings within them experience reality in a unique way.

## Jacob's Ladder

Jacob's Ladder is a metaphysical structure, which represents the formation of the realms of creation.  
The Ladder is viewed by many scholars and men of faith as the only path for common men to achieve "Enlightenment", "Godhood" , or "Ascension", and is believed to have been "climbed" multiple times in recorded history to achieve the aforementioned state of "Absoluteness".
Many beliefs have their own interpretation on *how* to climb the Ladder, some sharing commonality, and some wildly different.
For example, the people of [Babel](../locations/babel.html) believe that the Ladder is reached via "Reaching the sky's edge", which is why they have built the Tower.

### Etymology

The name of the Ladder refers to two things:  

- The Ladder's existence was discovered by [Jacob](../people/jacob.html), Son of [Isaac](../people/isaac.html).  
- As a result of the Ladder's nature, explained previously, it gained its current name.  

## Metatron

The Metatron is the highest and most unique of the realms, being that it is both a realm, and a being.  
Instead of it being created *by* the [Sephirot](sephirot.html), it *is* a sephirot, specifically "Keter / Metatron", its namesake.  
In addition, this realm is the residence and "Brain" of the [Angel](../lifeforms/angels.html) race's network. From there the Angels come and go as needed.  
This realm is the topmost part of the Ladder, as well as it's ending point.
