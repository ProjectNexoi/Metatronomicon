## Aggadium

Aggadium is considered as one of the world's most resistant and strongest materials. One of the prized properties this metal possesses is its high heat toleration, in excess of tens of thousands of degrees.  

### Origin

This metal's source is still veiled in mystery, but according to folklore and many religious texts, it is written that the [Leviathan](../lifeforms/primordials.html), while escaping from [PLANETNAMEHERE](../cosmicarchitecture/placehold) after its duel with the [Behemoth](../lifeforms/primordials.md), grazed past the moon of [Ammakinn](../cosmicarchitecture/ammakinn.html), sending shards of its surface hurling down towards PLANETNAMEHERE.  These shards are believed to be Aggadium.
