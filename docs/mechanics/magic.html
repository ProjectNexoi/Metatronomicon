        <h1 id="magic">Magic</h1>
<p>Magic is, by definition, the alteration of <em>Fate</em>, through the usage of <em>Will</em>, transmitted by <em>Words</em>.<br />
It is the act of, instead of conforming to the world, making the world conform to you.<br />
Through Magic, actions which are otherwise impossible become possible, like draining an ocean and toppling a mountain.  </p>
<h2 id="fate">Fate</h2>
<p>The concept of Fate is something everything has, be it living or inanimate.<br />
It does not matter if it has been created by nature, by human hands, or from the fire of a dragon, every existing object has this intangible, unobservable component.
However, Fate isn't incorrigible. Like all other things in existence, it is influenced by the world.<br />
The Fate of an object is the final position it occupies, plus the path it Will go through to get there, e.g. if there is a ball rolling down the slope of a hill, it is its Fate to reach the bottom of the slope, through the action of rolling down a certain path.  </p>
<h2 id="will">Will</h2>
<p>However, Fate is subject to change. It is not set in stone.
Fate is like a river, flowing down the path of least resistance. But a river can be redirected, in this case, through the usage of Will.
Will is the expression of the soul, and is exclusive to life, excluding a few exceptions.
If a being wishes to create Magic, and change the environment, Will is a necessity to this operation.
It is a force that is exuded from the soul of a being, that alters the Fate of whatever object it was directed upon, imprinting itself onto the recipient therefore changing its Fate.<br />
The strength of an individual's Will is directly proportional to the strength of its soul, a weak soul trying to change the Fate of a strong Fate is paramount to throwing a rock on a mountain, and expecting the mountain to fall over.
Will cannot exist in a vacuum; it must be produced by a sentient life-form AND be given intent, by which to act upon the world.</p>
