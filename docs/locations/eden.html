<h2 id="banishment-of-humankind">Banishment of Humankind</h2>
<p>After the establishment of Eden, <a href="../people/adam.html">Adam</a> and Eve had many children within Eden, and all were happy.<br />
Many years later, tragedy struck. Eve, Adam's wife, was on her deathbed. It was natural, the way all beings must end.<br />
However, Adam was not willing to accept that fact. He scoured the world in search of a way to stop it, or at least; delay it. But alas, he had found no such thing.<br />
Seeing this from their <a href="../cosmicarchitecture/tethomot.html">moon</a>, an ancient dragon named <a href="../lifeforms/dragons.html#rahab">Rahab</a>'s greed and envy and cruelty overflowed. In a rare show of modesty, he contacted the Demon king <a href="../lifeforms/demons.html#asmodeus">Asmodeus</a> in order to hatch a plan. The relationship between the two was strenuous at best, but they decided to temporarily put their differences aside to at least make use of this opportunity.<br />
They would convince Adam to commit the most heinous crime of all.<br />
On Adam's travels to find a cure, had climbed on top of <a href="../locations/">Mount. dontremembernameinasec</a>, the tallest place in <a href="../cosmicarchitecture/">planetnamehere</a>, laid down on its peak, and looked upwards.<br />
The two did not waste a moment, and with all thier might, conjoured a message to Adam's mind.<br />
It read: "If you may take of Eden's fruit, and feed it to Her; She shall live forevermore."<br />
Adam was immediately enthralled in this promise. The moment he saw a single glimpse of hope, he latched onto it, and ran as fast as his legs could carry him, back towards that great city.<br />
It took him seven days and seven7 nights to complete the journey, and he almost didn't make it in time.<br />
He rushed to the trunk of the great protector. He climbed for seven hours, until he had reached the top.<br />
Upon seeing the mountainous canopy, and the countless fruit he reached out his hand, and plucked a single one from a branch.  </p>
<p>Instantly, a great thunder shook the very foundations of Creation, and a wrath, greater than any other in all history was felt in each and every crevice of every place.
It is told that on that day, all life felt absolute fear, for the first time.<br />
A legion of angels descended on the city, and exiled all the living beings inside, with ultimate authority and raised swords.<br />
The city was torn from the surface of planetnamehere, only leaving behind the banished races.
As additional punishment, all children of Adam were killed excepting the first six of the children three men; Cain, Abel, and Seth; and three women their wives.
Adam himself was said to bear the greatest retribution; so horrible, no words shall be written of it.<br />
And thus man had lost paradise, due to a futile attempt to subvert and overcome the laws of Creation.  </p>
