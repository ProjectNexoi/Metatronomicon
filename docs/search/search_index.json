A realm's size is non-finite, and beings within them experience reality in a unique way. Jacob's Ladder Jacob's Ladder is a metaphysical structure, which represents the formation of the realms of creation. The Ladder is viewed by many scholars and men of faith as the only path for common men to achieve \"Enlightenment\", \"Godhood\" , or \"Ascension\", and is believed to have been \"climbed\" multiple times in recorded history to achieve the aforementioned state of \"Absoluteness\". Many beliefs have their own interpretation on how to climb the Ladder, some sharing commonality, and some wildly different. For example, the people of Babel believe that the Ladder is reached via \"Reaching the sky's edge\", which is why they have built the Tower. Etymology The name of the Ladder refers to two things: The Ladder's existence was discovered by Jacob , Son of Isaac . As a result of the Ladder's nature, explained previously, it gained its current name. Metatron The Metatron is the highest and most unique of the realms, being that it is both a realm, and a being. Instead of it being created by the Sephirot , it is a sephirot, specifically \"Keter / Metatron\", its namesake. In addition, this realm is the residence and \"Brain\" of the Angel race's network.

The dragons are not completely biological and certain parts of them are composed out of various inorganic materials, such as rare metals and durable sediment-like substances. These almost mechanical parts of the dragons are their scales, bones and other rigid tissue. They are constructed by the parents of the said dragon, and are filled with biological tissue and energy. The dragon eventually fuses with the inorganic part of its body, becoming completely inseparable from it. Dragons do not have two distinct sexes and do not possess any reproductive organs. See Also: Dragon Scale . Lifecycle The dragon is born from a metal shell created by its parents which is infused with large amounts of their magic, soul-mass, and biological tissue. This proccess results in the creation of offspring. The newborn is nurtured by the parents for a long period of time, from a few centuries to millennia, depending on the species. This process involves teaching the young dragon of the world and training it in various things, e.g. magic and the blacksmithery needed to create the next generation. The parents continue to infuse various metals with the dragon's shell, which has by then completely fused itself with the biological tissues within the young dragon's body, creating its iconic scales and their recognizable sheen. This process also causes the dragon to grow monumentally larger than its original size. When reaching a sufficient age, the now mature dragon departs from its parents, and finds a new dwelling for itself. This stage of the dragon's life-cycle is the longest and plays the biggest part in the it's life. During this time, the dragon usually pillages and ravages the area around it, sometimes flying off to far-away locations in order to gather stronger and larger amounts of metals, in order to strengthen its carapace and grow even larger. This behavior results in the fascinating outcome that every dragon's scales are completely unique, as a result of the distinct composition they possess. Many dragons, especially the ones more adept at magic, will inscribe patterns and even portraits of the land and recognizable elements within it, such as the night sky, or a large mountain, onto their scales. Due to this, draconic scales hold immeasurable value to those in the field of archeology and historians, because these scales act as a sort of time capsule in history, which is perfectly preserved as a result of the fact that dragon scales are an extremely durable alloy of rare materials. The dragon throughout this phase of its life establishes dominance in the area it has settled in, mostly preventing any outside interference with the land it lays claim to. When the dragon has reached a certain age, unique to each species, it starts to seek out a partner, with which to produce offspring. When the dragon finds a suitable partner, one out of their dwellings is chosen, where the other one will move into. The dwelling which has not been chosen will be abandoned. All dragons are inherently monogamous, meaning that they only have one pair, in the entirety of their lives. The dragon pair then takes turns recovering sufficient materials, to create offspring. The parents then construct a shell out of the metals and various materials they have collected, to be their future child, they both inject various elements (Refer to Stage I) into the carapace, and thus create offspring. Each dragon pair can produce between 1-3 children, until they run out of the energy needed to create more children, which is when they will stop doing as such and live out the rest of their lives. Abilities Strength All Dragons possess immense physical strength. On average, a dragon's full power is equivelant to a small nuclear armament, capable of instantly annhilating a large city. OF course, usage of this significant amount of energy drains the Dragon, thus making the said attack usable as more of a last-resort type of attack. Magic Breath A Dragons breath is one of the abilities they possess. It is a specialized form of magic, aided by biological/mechanical mechanisms within their bodies. A Dragon's breath is the only known way to produce a temperature high enough to melt Dragon Scale reliably enough to use it for smithing.

The undead form when a corpse that is completely devoid of all previous soul matter finds itself in a senticule-rich area. In those conditions, with sufficient senticule density, the spiritual particles start to organize themselves into a cell-like formation and are instilled into the carcass. From there, the pseudo-soul that is created will undergo a process similar to mitosis when in the presence of a receptive dead host. As a result of this process, all undead are naturally inclined to seek out other life and extinguish it in order to make more hosts and absorb more soul matter, to divide more. When an undead individual\u2019s soul has accumulated enough energy, and is in the situation where it cannot undergo division, the pseudo-soul will mature into a full soul and develop a mind. Undead who have experienced this change are completely unable to divide and reproduce.

It is the act of, instead of conforming to the world, making the world conform to you. Through Magic, actions which are otherwise impossible become possible, like draining an ocean and toppling a mountain. Fate The concept of Fate is something everything has, be it living or inanimate. It does not matter if it has been created by nature, by human hands, or from the fire of a dragon, every existing object has this intangible, unobservable component. However, Fate isn't incorrigible. Like all other things in existence, it is influenced by the world. The Fate of an object is the final position it occupies, plus the path it Will go through to get there, e.g. if there is a ball rolling down the slope of a hill, it is its Fate to reach the bottom of the slope, through the action of rolling down a certain path. Will However, Fate is subject to change. It is not set in stone. Fate is like a river, flowing down the path of least resistance. But a river can be redirected, in this case, through the usage of Will. Will is the expression of the soul, and is exclusive to life, excluding a few exceptions. If a being wishes to create Magic, and change the environment, Will is a necessity to this operation. It is a force that is exuded from the soul of a being, that alters the Fate of whatever object it was directed upon, imprinting itself onto the recipient therefore changing its Fate.

This Expansion includes two additional particles, named the \"Senticule\", and the \"Magitron\". Additionally, two fundemental interactions, \"forces\", are also present, the Spiritual force, and the Magical force. The particles mentioned above are their carriers, respectively. Particles Senticule The Senticule, also referred to as \"Soul-Matter\" is a fundemental particle (e.g. it cannot be divided or broken down into smaller parts), and the carrier of the Spiritual force. Commonly, a Soul , or spirit, is thought to be indivisible and unmeasurable, as sort of an invisible, true identity, of a person and/or being. However, this is factually wrong. In reality, the Soul is measurable and violable, as a result of it existing within the natural order of existence. It is a structure of Senticules, and can be replicated and changed. This also applies to the Mind . However, a Senticule's role does not end at merely composing a person, for it also has other uses. When a person dies, his soul destroyed, deformed or in any other way interfered with, an amount of Senticules is released, according to the magnitude of the aforementioned interference. As a result of that, when enough Soul-Mass is accumulated, Undead will form in the vicinity if possible. Magitron The Magitron, commonly known as \"Magic\", or \"Magical Energy\", is a fundemental particle, as well as the carreier of the Magical Force. This particle has a unique attribute, that being that it must carry a certain Will .
