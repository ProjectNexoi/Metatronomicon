A realm's size is non-finite, and beings within them experience reality in a unique way. Jacob's Ladder Jacob's Ladder is a metaphysical structure, which represents the formation of the realms of creation. The Ladder is viewed by many scholars and men of faith as the only path for common men to achieve \"Enlightenment\", \"Godhood\" , or \"Ascension\", and is believed to have been \"climbed\" multiple times in recorded history to achieve the aforementioned state of \"Absoluteness\". Many beliefs have their own interpretation on how to climb the Ladder, some sharing commonality, and some wildly different. For example, the people of Babel believe that the Ladder is reached via \"Reaching the sky's edge\", which is why they have built the Tower. Etymology The name of the Ladder refers to two things: The Ladder's existence was discovered by Jacob , Son of Isaac . As a result of the Ladder's nature, explained previously, it gained its current name. Metatron The Metatron is the highest and most unique of the realms, being that it is both a realm, and a being. Instead of it being created by the Sephirot , it is a sephirot, specifically \"Keter / Metatron\", its namesake. In addition, this realm is the residence and \"Brain\" of the Angel race's network.

However, do not make the mistake that the biological part is \"actually\" their true selves, like the brains of humans. The Dragons' entire body is their \"brain\", in a metaphorical sense. Dragons do not have two distinct sexes and do not possess any reproductive organs. Behavior Abilities Strength All Dragons possess immense physical strength. Certain myths tell of them being able to crush an entire palace easily. Magic A particularly core ability of a Dragon is Magic . After a Dragon is created, it is taught Magic by its parents, and is not recognized as an adult until it masters the subject. Magic is essential for the success of a Dragons lifecycle, due to the fact that it is required to reproduce, and alleviate the effort of moving one's massive body, among other important usages. A Dragon's capability for Magic is, from birth, incredibely high due to being directly descended from the Leviathan, a Primordial. Breath A Dragons breath is one of the abilities they possess.

In those conditions, with sufficient senticule density, the spiritual particles start to organize themselves into a cell-like formation and are instilled into the carcass. From there, the pseudo-soul that is created will undergo a process similar to mitosis when in the presence of a receptive dead host. As a result of this process, all undead are naturally inclined to seek out other life and extinguish it in order to make more hosts and absorb more soul matter, to divide more. When an undead individual\u2019s soul has accumulated enough energy, and is in the situation where it cannot undergo division, the pseudo-soul will mature into a full soul and develop a mind.

It is the act of, instead of conforming to the world, making the world conform to you. Through Magic, actions which are otherwise impossible become possible, like draining an ocean and toppling a mountain. Fate The concept of Fate is something everything has, be it living or inanimate. It does not matter if it has been created by nature, by human hands, or from the fire of a dragon, every existing object has this intangible, unobservable component. However, Fate isn't incorrigible. Like all other things in existence, it is influenced by the world. The Fate of an object is the final position it occupies, plus the path it Will go through to get there, e.g. if there is a ball rolling down the slope of a hill, it is its Fate to reach the bottom of the slope, through the action of rolling down a certain path. Will However, Fate is subject to change. It is not set in stone. Fate is like a river, flowing down the path of least resistance. But a river can be redirected, in this case, through the usage of Will. Will is the expression of the soul, and is exclusive to life, excluding a few exceptions. If a being wishes to create Magic, and change the environment, Will is a necessity to this operation. It is a force that is exuded from the soul of a being, that alters the Fate of whatever object it was directed upon, imprinting itself onto the recipient therefore changing its Fate. The strength of an individual's Will is directly proportional to the strength of its soul, a weak soul trying to change the Fate of a strong Fate is paramount to throwing a rock on a mountain, and expecting the mountain to fall over.

In the Metatronomicon Universe, there exists an expanded system of physics, different from ours. This Expansion includes two additional particles, named the \"Senticule\", and the \"Magitron\". Additionally, two fundemental interactions, \"forces\", are also present, the Spiritual force, and the Magical force. The particles mentioned above are their carriers, respectively. Particles Senticule The Senticule, also referred to as \"Soul-Matter\" is a fundemental particle (e.g. it cannot be divided or broken down into smaller parts), and the carrier of the Spiritual force. Commonly, a Soul , or spirit, is thought to be indivisible and unmeasurable, as sort of an invisible, true identity, of a person and/or being. However, this is factually wrong. In reality, the Soul is measurable and violable, as a result of it existing within the natural order of existence. It is a structure of Senticules, and can be replicated and changed. This also applies to the Mind . However, a Senticule's role does not end at merely composing a person, for it also has other uses. When a person dies, his soul destroyed, deformed or in any other way interfered with, an amount of Senticules is released, according to the magnitude of the aforementioned interference. As a result of that, when enough Soul-Mass is accumulated, Undead will form in the vicinity if possible. Magitron The Magitron, commonly known as \"Magic\", or \"Magical Energy\", is a fundemental particle, as well as the carreier of the Magical Force. This particle has a unique attribute, that being that it must carry a certain Will .
