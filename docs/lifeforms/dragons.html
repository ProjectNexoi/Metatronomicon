<p>The dragons are the direct creations of the Leviathan, an ancient being and one of the three <a href="primordials.html">Primordials</a>.
These beings can be defined more accurately not as <em>life</em>, but as <em>machine</em>. While they do have a non-negligable amount of biological tissue, they overwhelming majority of their bodymass is inorganic.<br />
However, do not make the mistake that the biological part is "actually" their true selves, like the brains of humans. The Dragons' <em>entire</em> body is their "brain", in a metaphorical sense.
Dragons do not have two distinct sexes and do not possess any reproductive organs.</p>

<p>All Dragons possess immense physical strength.<br />
Certain myths tell of them being able to crush an entire palace easily.</p>
<h3 id="magic">Magic</h3>
<p>A particularly core ability of a Dragon is <a href="../mechanics/magic.html">Magic</a>.<br />
After a Dragon is created, it is taught Magic by its parents, and is not recognized as an adult until it masters the subject.<br />
Magic is essential for the success of a Dragons lifecycle, due to the fact that it is required to reproduce, and alleviate the effort of moving one's massive body, among other important usages.<br />
A Dragon's capability for Magic is, from birth, incredibely high due to being directly descended from the Leviathan, a Primordial.  </p>
<h3 id="breath">Breath</h3>
<p>A Dragons breath is one of the abilities they possess. It is a specialized form of magic, aided by biological/mechanical mechanisms within their bodies.<br />
A Dragon's breath is the only known way to produce a temperature high enough to melt Dragon Scale reliably enough to use it for smithing.<br />
It is not known to which temparatures dragon's breath can reach.  </p>

<p>The Mountain King is the name given to a Dragon whose territory borders the.<br />
The Dragon's scale is said to be "Half a mountain's size", according to rare accounts where the Dragon was witnessed.
The source for its name is the nature of its domain, a lone mountain named "PLACEHOLDER", measured to be the tallest ever recorded, exceeding 10,000 meters. Its domain also encompasses the forest that surrounds said mountain.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong>  King of the Lesser Waters</p>
<p>Lord over the western sea, "Rahab" in ancient texts, is an incredibly powerful Dragon.<br />
Not much is known of it, outside of myth and legends. All that can be said with certainty is its wickedness, and absolute greed.  </p>
