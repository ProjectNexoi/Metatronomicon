# Undead (Psuedo-Formanoids)

The undead are a type of lifeform that can only reproduce and exist in the carcasses of other lifeforms, resulting in them having a parasitic relationship with them. The undead form when a corpse that is completely devoid of all previous soul matter finds itself in a senticule-rich area.  
In those conditions, with sufficient senticule density, the spiritual particles start to organize themselves into a cell-like formation and are instilled into the carcass. From there, the pseudo-soul that is created will undergo a process similar to mitosis when in the presence of a receptive dead host. As a result of this process, all undead are naturally inclined to seek out other life and extinguish it in order to make more hosts and absorb more soul matter, to divide more.  
When an undead individual’s soul has accumulated enough energy, and is in the situation where it cannot undergo division, the pseudo-soul will mature into a full soul and develop a mind.  
Undead who have experienced this change are completely unable to divide and reproduce. The creatures that are created as a result of this method are called “True Formanoids”, more commonly known as liches.
