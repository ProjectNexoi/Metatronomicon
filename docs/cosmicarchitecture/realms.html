        <h1 id="realms">Realms</h1>
<p>The realms are a collective name for 5 distinct spaces, which comprise the entirety of creation.<br />
A realm's size is non-finite, and beings within them experience reality in a unique way.</p>
<h2 id="jacobs-ladder">Jacob's Ladder</h2>
<p>Jacob's Ladder is a metaphysical structure, which represents the formation of the realms of creation.<br />
The Ladder is viewed by many scholars and men of faith as the only path for common men to achieve "Enlightenment", "Godhood" , or "Ascension", and is believed to have been "climbed" multiple times in recorded history to achieve the aforementioned state of "Absoluteness".
Many beliefs have their own interpretation on <em>how</em> to climb the Ladder, some sharing commonality, and some wildly different.
For example, the people of <a href="../locations/babel.html">Babel</a> believe that the Ladder is reached via "Reaching the sky's edge", which is why they have built the Tower.</p>
<h3 id="etymology">Etymology</h3>
<p>The name of the Ladder refers to two things:<br />
- The Ladder's existence was discovered by Jacob, Son of Isaac.<br />
- As a result of the Ladder's nature, explained previously, it gained its current name.  </p>
<h2 id="metatron">Metatron</h2>
<p>The Metatron is the highest and most unique of the realms, being that it is both a realm, and a being.<br />
Instead of it being created <em>by</em> the <a href="sephirot.html">Sephirot</a>, it <em>is</em> a sephirot, specifically "Keter / Metatron", its namesake.<br />
In addition, this realm is the residence and "Brain" of the <a href="../lifeforms/angels.html">Angel</a> race's network. From there the Angels come and go as needed.<br />
This realm is the topmost part of the Ladder, as well as it's ending point.</p>
